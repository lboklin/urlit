# URL In Titlebar
Very simple extension that adds the url of the current page to the titlebar of the browser.

Get it for Firefox on AMO:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/url-in-titlebar/

It's super simplistic, but useful for e.g. keepassx to know which password to enter with autotype.
